A web-based project developed in ASP.NET, allows the administrator to communicate between the project leaders and programmers and allows them to maintain the login and logout time. The project also maintains offline messages, i.e. the messages that were sent online, can be viewed even when you are offline, but obviously, you cannot send any message when you are offline. The main features of the Client-Server Communication system are
Sending Messages: The project leader can interact with each and every programmer using this software.
Chatting: Communication with a colleague will be made easy using the chat option.
Login and Logout Time: When a programmer logs in, the login time is recorded and also the logout time is recorded. This report will be sent to the project leader so that they can ensure that everybody is working fine. Also, the login and logout times of the project leaders will be visible to the admins. Hence, admin is the highest in the hierarchy, and then comes the project leaders, and the lowest level in the hierarchy is that of the programmers.
